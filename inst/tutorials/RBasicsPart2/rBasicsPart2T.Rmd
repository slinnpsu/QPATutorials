--- 

## Learning Objectives

This tutorial is designed to familiarize you with some of the basics of using R. Specifically, you will learn:

* How to read in R data or .RData files with the `load()` function
* How to read in comma separated or .csv files, tab delimited or .txt files, and Stata data or .dta files using the `import()` function from the <span style="color:DarkGreen">rio</span> package
* How to get to know the structure of your data with the `class()`, `View()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `names()`, `head()`, `str()`, `is.na()`, `sum()` functions
* How to access variables in a data frame using $
* How to execute simple functions on variables: `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `range()`
* How to create a new variable and store it in a data frame
* How to use the `save()` function to save objects as a .RData file

## Data Files

The data we looked at in Part 1 was manually entered. More likely, we will work with a data set created somewhere else or by someone else that has been saved as one of several types of files. Regardless of the type of data file, data sets share a common structure. You can think of a spreadsheet. Each row of the data set contains data for one observation: values of all variables for a single case. Each column of the data set contains values of a single variable for all observations.

Each row of the data set below contains an observation for a single county in the US. Each column records values of variables measured for each county in the 2016 presidential election.


![](images/DataEx.png){width=70%}

R will read in virtually any type of data file you might wish. We will introduce the `load()` function for reading in R data(.RData) files and the `import()` function in the R package <span style="color:DarkGreen">rio</span> for reading in comma-delimited (.csv), Excel (.xls and .xlsx) Stata data (.dta) files, and tab-delimited (.txt) files. Other types of files can be read with `import()`, but this covers all the types of files we will use this semester.

## Loading R data files (extension .RData)

R has its own file format, denoted with .RData, .rdata, or .rda. We use the `load()` function to read in these files. Note that we do not need to specify any arguments other than the file name.  

**Also, note that when the file has loaded, the objects it contains will already exist. This means you do not assign the result of `load()` to a new object. If you do so, it will have no effect. To learn the name of any objects in the .RData file, use the `verbose` argument inside `load()`, and set it equal to TRUE.**

When naming the file containing the data, you will need to tell the function where the file is located. If the data file is in the same directory as the file containing your code, no path is required. But if you are working on a local machine or if the data is not in your working directory, you will need to specify a full path.  


```{r loadr-setup}
save(counties, file = "counties2016.RData")
#rm(list=ls())
```

```{r loadr, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="loadr-setup"}
load("counties2016.RData", verbose = TRUE)
```

Now that we know the name of the object the file contains, we can examine **counties**

```{r viewr, exercise=TRUE}
counties
```

You can navigate around this file. To see more variables click on the black triangle at the top right. To see more observations select the blue numbers on the bottom of the output.

## Importing other file types


You can import all files in all kinds of data formats in R using various packages. To simplify, we will use the `import()` function in the R package <span style="color:DarkGreen">rio</span>. The function uses the file extension to determine the file type and then runs the appropriate functions behind the scenes so that you don't have to learn the functions for each file type. 

**Unlike .RData files, you need to assign the file to an object.** Commit this fact to memory. Students often forget to assign the results of the `import()` function to a named data frame or they try to assign the results of the `load()` function to a named data frame. 

Here again, if the file is not in the same directory as your code file, you will need to specify the path to tell `import()` where to find the data file.

Because the functions in the package <span style="color:DarkGreen">rio</span> are not a part of base R, we need to load the package with the `library()` function before we can use the `import()` function. (I have already installed this package for use in the tutorial.)

### Comma-separated files

Let's import the comma-separated (.csv) file, unitednations.csv, and examine its contents. Here, I've assigned the file to the object **unFBposts**. But you could name it anything you like, as long as it does not start with a number of use reserved characters like $ and #.

```{r df-setup}
tmp.df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slinnpsu/PLSC309/master/unitednations.csv")
write.csv(tmp.df, "unitednations.csv", row.names = F)
rm(list=ls())
```


```{r df, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="df-setup"}
library(rio)
unFBposts <- import("unitednations.csv")
unFBposts
```

### Excel files

We import an Excel file in exactly the same manner. Let's import the file "example_data.xlsx." I'm naming this object **df**, short for data frame, but again, you may choose whatever you like. If you want to edit the code below to give the object a different name, try it. You'll need to replace the name in both places.

```{r df2-setup}
library(writexl)
tmp.df2 <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slinnpsu/PLSC309/master/example_data.xlsx")
write_xlsx(tmp.df2, "example_data.xlsx")
rm(list=ls())
#https://github.com/nsm5230/testRdata/raw/master/example.data.xls
```


```{r df2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="df2-setup"}
df <- import("example_data.xlsx")
df
```

### Stata data files

A Stata data file can be imported in the same manner. Stata data files will have a .dta extension. See if you can write the code to import "oilwomen.dta" without looking. Name your new object **oil** and then print it.


```{r df3-setup}
library(haven)
tmp.df3 <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slinnpsu/PLSC309/master/oilwomen.dta")
write_dta(tmp.df3, "oilwomen.dta")
rm(list=ls())
#https://github.com/nsm5230/testRdata/raw/master/example.data.xls
```

```{r df3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="df3-setup"}

```

```{r df3-solution}
oil <- import("oilwomen.dta")
oil
```

```{r df3-check}
grade_code()
```


### Tab-delimited files

Surprise, if we have a tab-delimited data file, we do the same thing! Read in "turnout2.txt," assign it to the object **TO** and print it.

```{r df4-setup}
tmp.df4 <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slinnpsu/PLSC309/master/turnout2.txt")
write.table(tmp.df4, "turnout2.txt", row.names = FALSE)
rm(list=ls())
#https://github.com/nsm5230/testRdata/raw/master/example.data.xls
```

```{r df4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="df4-setup"}

```

```{r df4-solution}
TO <- import("turnout2.txt")
TO
```

```{r df4-check}
grade_code()
```

## Learning about the data

The first step after loading a data set is to learn something about its contents. We will use the data set unitednations.csv, which we loaded as the object **unFBposts**. The data contains information related to the social media posts published on the United Nations Facebook page during 2015. Write the code below to determine the class of this object. 

```{r classname, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r classname-hint}
Place the name of the object inside the class function.
```


```{r classname-check}
grade_code("That's easy, right?")
```

```{r classname-solution}
class(unFBposts)
```


Each data set you read into R will have the class `data.frame`.  

### Viewing the contents of a data frame

As we saw above, you can view the data by simply typing its name. But you can view the contents of a data frame using the `View()` function or by double-clicking on the object name in the Global Environment tab in R Studio as well. (Note that this function begins with a capital letter.) This will open the data in a new window, which can make it easier to examine in full. No matter how you do so, it's a good idea to view your data frame to make sure you have loaded the data you intended. Note, however, that you cannot execute this function from within the tutorial. We will not run this function.


```{r view, exercise=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
View(unFBposts)
```


### Determining the number of rows and columns

Each row of a data frame contains a single observation, here a unique Facebook post. The `nrow()` function returns the number of rows in the data frame.  Simply pass the `nrow()` function the name of the data frame object. How many posts are in the data frame? 

```{r nrow, exercise=TRUE}
nrow(unFBposts)
```

Can you determine how many posts were published, on average, per day in 2015?

```{r howmanyposts, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r howmanyposts-hint}
There are 365 days in this year and the number of
rows in the data is given by nrows(unFBposts),
so divide the latter by the former.
```


```{r howmanyposts-check}
grade_code("So simple.")
```

```{r howmanyposts-solution}
nrow(unFBposts) / 365
```


Each column of a data frame contains a single variable. We use the `ncol()` function to learn the number of columns in the same manner as we used the `nrow()` function to learn the number of rows. How many variables are in **unFBposts**?

```{r ncolquest, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r ncolquest-hint}
Place the data object inside the ncol function
```

```{r ncolquest-solution}
ncol(unFBposts)
```

```{r ncolquest-check}
grade_code("")
```

### Determining variable names 

We've learned **unFBposts**  contains 1643 Facebook posts (rows) and 8 variables (columns). 

We can see the names of the variables in our data.frame using the `names()` function we introduced in the R Basics tutorial Part 1.


```{r names, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r names-hint}
Place the name of the data object inside the names function.
```

```{r names-solution}
names(unFBposts)
```

```{r names-check}
grade_code()
```

Here is a short description of each variable in the data set.

Name | Description
---------------- | --------------------------
type | Type of post (link, photo, video, ...)
date | Date when the post was published
likes_count | Total likes on post
comments_count | Total comments on the post
shares_count | Total shares of the post
month | Month when the post was published (numeric)
url | Direct URL of post
message | Text of post, NA if no text

### The `head()` and `str()` functions

We can examine the first few rows of the data frame using the `head()` function. By default, it prints the first 6 rows. To look at more or less, specify the `n` argument.

```{r str, exercise=TRUE}
head(unFBposts, n = 5)
```
The `str()` function displays the structure of the data frame. Specifically, it provides the number of observations and variables and then lists each variable along with its type and the values of the first few observations. 

```{r head, exercise=TRUE}
str(unFBposts)
```

 
The letter abbreviations that appear to the right of the column names describe the type of data that is stored in each column of **unFBposts**. Possible types include:

+ int: integers.
+ dbl: doubles, or real numbers.
+ chr: character vectors, or strings.
+ dttm: date-times (a date + a time).
+ fct: factor (categorical variable)

Look carefully at the output to see what you can learn about the data before continuing.


### The `summary()` function

The `summary()` function can be used to obtain some basic descriptive information about the contents of a data frame object. What information is displayed will depend on the class of the variable. For numeric variables, it will report the minimum value, the value at the 1st quartile, the median, the value at the third quartile, and the maximum value.

```{r summar, exercise=TRUE}
summary(unFBposts)
```

See if you can see the differences in the information provided for character and numeric variables.

## Working with variables in a data.frame

Often we will want to access a specific variable in a data frame. To do so  we use the `$` operator. Specifically, we type DATA_FRAME_NAME\$COLUMN_NAME. So, if we wanted to print the contents of the variable **type** in the data frame **unFBposts**, we would refer to it using **unFBposts$type**. 


```{r type, exercise=TRUE}
unFBposts$type
```

These are the values of the variable **type**.

## Missing values


When working with data frames, often some observations will not have data on one or more variables. A missing value code is assigned to these observations. We can use the `is.na()` function to learn about missing values. This function takes one argument, the name of the vector whose values we wish to evaluate.  The function returns a TRUE if a value of the vector is missing and FALSE if a value is not missing. 

```{r isna, exercise=TRUE}
is.na(unFBposts$message)
```


We can use this function to determine how many posts do not have any text (which are denoted with missing values). We need to wrap the `sum()` function around the `is.na()` function to answer this question. The `sum()` function will count the number of TRUE entries in the vector of messages.

See if you can write the code without looking at the hints.


```{r sumna, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r sumna-hint}
Did you specify is.na(unFBposts$message) inside the sum()
function?  Make sure your parentheses match! 
```


```{r sumna-solution}
sum(is.na(unFBposts$message))
```


```{r sumna-check}
grade_code()
```

How many missing values are there for the variable **likes_count**?

```{r sumna2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r sumna2-hint}
Wrap the sum function around the is.na function
applied to likes_count. Don't forget to name the
data object$ before listing the variable name.
```

```{r sumna2-solution}
sum(is.na(unFBposts$likes_count))
```

```{r sumna2-check}
grade_code()
```


You can also calculate the number of values of a variable that are *not* missing. The only difference is that you put an `!` in front of the `is.na()` function. This signifies *not* missing.  How many values of **likes_count** are not missing?

```{r sumna3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r sumna3-hint}
Wrap the sum function around the !is.na function
applied to likes_count. Don't forget to name the
data object$ before listing the variable name.
```

```{r sumna3-solution}
sum(!is.na(unFBposts$likes_count))
```

```{r sumna3-check}
grade_code()
```

### Handling missing values

Some functions will not work if there are missing values present. Above, we learned that there are 173 messages with no content. These are missing a message. None of the other variables have missing values. But often, we will encounter variables that are missing a value for at least one entry. 

If there are missing values in a vector, we include `na.rm = TRUE` (TRUE must be all caps) as an argument to many functions to tell R to drop the cases with missing values before executing the function.

Let's calculate the mean number of shares for UN Facebook posts, allowing for missing values (there are not any so we would get the same value if we did not use this option but we would get an error if we omit the option when there are missing values).

```{r naex, exercise=TRUE}
mean(unFBposts$shares, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Indexing in a data frame

We can use indexing to select rows and columns in a data frame, but unlike with a vector, we have two dimensions, so we specify the row and column index of interest.

For example, to see the 3rd row in the 2nd colum of **unFBposts** we use square brackets and list the row, followed by a comma, and the column:

```{r index1, exercise=TRUE}
unFBposts[3, 2]
```
If we want to list all values of a particular variable, say **type**, we leave the row number blank. If we want a sequence of row (or column numbers), we use the smallest value followed by a colon and the largest value (no spaces). We can also give the variable name in quotes rather than the column number. The code below prints rows 10-15 of the variable **type**.

```{r index2, exercise=TRUE}
unFBposts[10:15, "type"]
```

We are likely to use indexing with a single variable in a data frame object. For example, we might want to know which message had the most likes. Here we name the variable and in square brackets use the `which()` function applied to the variable **likes_count**, setting it equal (with two equal signs) to the same variable and removing missing values. This tells R to find the index value or values for which **likes_count** is largest and use that value to identify the **message** associated with it. This code can be helpful for identifying values of a variable when you don't know the indiex value. Here there is only one message with the maximum number of likes so it returns just one message.

```{r index3, exercise=TRUE}
unFBposts$message[which(unFBposts$likes_count == max(unFBposts$likes_count, na.rm = TRUE))]
```

You may want to find the message with the minimum value. It turns out in this data set there are many messages with zero shares and likes. To avoid printing many, many messages, let's try finding the message with the maximum number of shares using **shares_count**.

```{r index4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r index4-solution}
unFBposts$message[which(unFBposts$shares_count == max(unFBposts$shares_count, na.rm = TRUE))]
```

```{r index4-hint}
Specify unFBposts$message[] and inside the [] use the which()
function and inside it set unFBposts$shares_count == to
max(unFBposts$shares_count). Set the na.rm argument to TRUE
```

```{r index4-check}
grade_code()
```

We will show later in the course how to use indexing to recode variables.

## Creating a new variable in a data frame

Often you will want to create a new variable from those already in the data frame and have that new variable be stored in the data frame. For example, we might want to create a variable that counts the total number of likes and shares a post receives. To do so, we first select a name for the new variable, let's call it **like.or.share**. To have that variable created inside the data frame **unFBposts**, we type **unFBposts\$like.or.share**. To that variable we assign the sum of the variables **likes_count** and **shares_count**. Each of these variables most also be prefaced with **unFBposts\$** so that R knows to find them in the data frame **unFBposts**.  This code will not produce any output on your screen.

```{r newvara, exercise=TRUE}
unFBposts$like.or.share <- unFBposts$likes_count + unFBposts$shares_count
```

We can examine the first few values of this new variable using the `head()` function.

```{r newvarb, exercise=TRUE}
head(unFBposts$like.or.share)
```

Try creating a variable called **attention** that is the sum of all types of attention paid to a post: likes, shares, and comments. Store the new variable in the data frame **unFBposts** and list the first few values.


```{r newvar, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r newvar-solution}
unFBposts$attention <- unFBposts$likes_count + unFBposts$shares_count + unFBposts$comments_count
head(unFBposts$attention)
```

```{r newvar-hint-1}
Specify unFBposts$attention and the assignment operator <-
```

```{r newvar-hint-2}
To the right of the assignment operator, type the data frame name followed
by the dollar sign and likes_count. Then include a plus sign and
similarly add unFBposts$shares_count and unFBposts$comments_count
```

```{r newvar-hint-3}
On a new line, wrap the new variable inside the head() function
```

```{r newvar-check}
grade_code()
```


## Saving the data

Objects we create in an R session will be temporarily saved in the *workspace*, which is just the current working environment. If we want to save them permanently, we *could*  save the workspace. R will ask us if we want to save the workspace every time we exit. **say no**! Instead, if you want to save the objects (or some subset of the objects) you've created in your R session, use the `save()` function, which takes as arguments the names of the objects you wish to save and the name of the file to give your new data file.

The following code saves **unFBposts** as an R data set, but it cannot be run from the tutorial.


```{r save, exercise=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
save(unFBposts, file = "/Users/sld8/Dropbox/PLSC309/MyDataFile.Rdata")
```

If we had created new objects separate from those in **unFBposts**, saving **unFBposts** will not save them. 



## Practice 

Using the functions we've covered so far, do your best to answer the following questions. 


1. How many posts were published in 2015?

```{r howmany2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r howmany2-hint}
Since each row of the data contains one post, we can use the nrow() 
function to get the answer.
```

```{r howmany2-solution}
nrow(unFBposts)
```

```{r howmany2-check}
grade_code()
```

2. What was the text of the first post ("message") in the data set?

```{r text, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r text-hint}
Use the indexing function -- [ ] -- and specify the first 
row.
```

```{r text-solution}
unFBposts$message[1]
```

```{r text-check}
grade_code()
```

3. How many likes did posts receive on average?

```{r likes, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r likes-hint}
The mean function will return the average numbers of likes.
Include the na.rm argument. It's always good practice.
```

```{r likes-solution}
mean(unFBposts$likes_count, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r likes-check}
grade_code()
```

4. How many comments did posts receive on average?

```{r mean, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r mean-hint}
The mean function will return the average  number of posts. 
Include the na.rm argument. It's always good practice.
```

```{r mean-solution}
mean(unFBposts$comments_count, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r mean-check}
grade_code()
```

5. How many shares did posts receive on average?

```{r shares, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r shares-hint}
Use the mean function with the na.rm argument sent to TRUE.
```


```{r shares-solution}
mean(unFBposts$shares_count, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r shares-check}
grade_code()
```

6. What was the largest number of shares a post received? 

```{r max, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r max-hint}
The max function will provide this information.
```

```{r max-solution}
max(unFBposts$shares_count)
```

```{r max-check}
grade_code()
```

7. What was the smallest number of likes a post received?

```{r min, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r min-hint}
Use the min function to find the smallest number of likes
associated with a post.
```

```{r min-solution}
min(unFBposts$likes_count)
```

```{r min-check}
grade_code()
```

8. What was the range of the number of shares a post received?

```{r range, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r range-hint}
The range function will provide this information.
```

```{r range-solution}
range(unFBposts$shares_count)
```

```{r range-check}
grade_code()
```

## Good Work!
