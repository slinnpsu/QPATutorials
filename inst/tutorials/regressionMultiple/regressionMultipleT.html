<div id="section-multiple-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>When we conduct a regression analysis, it is seldom appropriate to
estimate a simple regression model with one independent variable. This
is because we need to control for other variables that may influence the
outcome, or we risk drawing the wrong conclusions from our analysis.</p>
<p>While we are often interested in the effects of a single explanatory
variable on some outcome, we considered three cases in which it is
important to control for other factors by including additional variables
in our model.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">Spurious Relationships</span>. A spurious
relationship is one that appears to be true but is not, in fact, true.
This occurs when an explanatory variable in our model has no effect on
our outcome variable. Instead, some other variable causes both our
explanatory variable and the outcome. If this is the true state of the
world, a simple regression will indicate a relationship between our
explanatory variable and the outcome when it doesn’t exist. To ensure we
don’t find spurious relationships in our analyses, we need to think
carefully about whether some additional variables might explain both our
independent and dependent variables. If so, our remedy is to control for
those variables by adding them to the model. When we do, the effect of
our explanatory variable will disappear if it is spuriously related to
the outcome.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">Multiple, correlated independent
variables.</span> The second case represents the most common situation
you will encounter in your analysis: when we have omitted variables that
are correlated with the variables in our model and that also cause the
outcome. In this situation, if we omit any of these explanatory
variables from our regression model, the estimated effects of the
included variables will be biased because they capture some of the
effects of the omitted variables. Thus, we need to think carefully about
the multitude of factors that might influence the outcome and include
any in our model that are correlated with our independent variables.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">Conditional or interactive
relationships</span>. If the effect of some variable depends on the
level of another variable, the relationship is said to be conditional or
interactive. In this case, we need to interact the two variables. We’ll
talk more about this in another tutorial.</p>
<p>We will first consider multiple regression models involving interval
level variables and then consider nominal variables with multiple
categories.</p>
</div>
<div

class="section level2">
<h2>Regression with Multiple Interval Level Independent Variables</h2>
<p>As an illustration of multiple regression, we will consider
county-level election outcomes in the 2016 presidential election.
Previously we’ve estimated simple regression models that looked at the
effect of wage growth and percent of blacks in the county population as
potential explanations for the percent of the two-party vote cast for
Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>We know many factors influence how counties cast their votes, and
many of these are likely to be correlated with wage growth and with the
percentage of blacks in the county. We will consider the health of the
residents of the county, which may be poorer in counties where wages are
lower; the percent of a county’s residents with a college degree, which
is likely to be positively correlated with wage growth; the percent of a
county’s residents that are white, black, and Hispanic, which are also
likely to be correlated with wage growth.</p>
<p>We will use the data frame <strong>counties</strong> and our
dependent variable will be <strong>dem2p_percent</strong>, the percent
of the two-party vote for Hillary Clinton. Our explanatory variables
are: <strong>wage_growth</strong>, the percent by which wages grew or
fell over the last four years; <strong>mortality_risk_25_45</strong>,
which gives the probability of dying between the ages of 25 and 45 given
that someone was in this age range (as a percent);
<strong>black_percent</strong>, <strong>white_percent</strong>,
<strong>hispanic_percent</strong>, and
<strong>percent_college_grad</strong>, which are each the percent of the
county’s residents in that demographic.</p>
<div
id="section-estimating-a-regression-with-multiple-independent-variables"
class="section level3">
<h3>Estimating a Regression with Multiple Independent Variables</h3>
<p>Running a regression in R with multiple independent variables is a
straightforward extension of the simple regression case. We use the
<code>lm()</code> function and specify the dependent variable followed
by the tilde, and then we list each independent variable separating each
with a plus sign. As with simple regression, we need to provide the
<code>data</code> argument.</p>
<p>The code below illustrates the code to estimate our model and saves
the result to the object <strong>model1</strong>, which we then pass to
the <code>summary()</code> function to produce the results. Look
carefully at the code. You will need to generate similar code below.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="lm1" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>model1 &lt;- lm(dem2p_percent ~ mortality_risk_25_45 + wage_growth + college_grad_percent + hispanic_percent + white_percent + black_percent, data = counties)
summary(model1)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Look carefully at the output. Find the estimated coefficients, the
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistics, p-values, and
measures of model fit. See what conclusions you can draw from the
information before you continue.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interpret-the-estimated-coefficients"
class="section level3">
<h3>Interpret the Estimated Coefficients</h3>
<p><span style="color:blue">The intercept</span>. We begin our
interpretation with the intercept, which is 73.42484. <em>This tells us
that if a county had a mortality risk of zero, flat wages, and no
college graduates, Hispanics, Whites, or Blacks lived in the county, we
expect them to cast 73% of their votes for Hillary Clinton.</em> Clearly
there are no counties that fit these criteria, so we will not say any
more about the intercept.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">The slope</span>. Before going into the
interpretation of specific slope coefficients, it is often good to start
interpretation by looking at the signs of the variables in the model.
Coefficient signs that are not consistent with our expectations can
suggest that we’ve not controlled for another variable that is
correlated with the included variables.</p>
<p>Look carefully at the output. Mortality risk and the percent of white
residents are negatively signed. This suggests that as the risk of dying
goes up in the county, vote for Hillary Clinton fell. This makes sense
if those in counties where more younger adults are dying were
dissatisfied with the current Democratic president, Barack Obama, and
wanted a change in the party in the White House as a result. The
negative sign on <strong>percent_white</strong> is consistent with the
expectation that white voters were less likely to vote Democratic and
more likely to vote Republican.</p>
<p>All other variables are positively signed, again, as we would expect.
The greater the percentage of college-educated adults, Blacks, and
Hispanics in each county, the greater the percentage of votes cast for
Hillary Clinton. Voters in counties with higher wage growth, a positive
economic outcome, rewarded the incumbent party’s candidate in higher
percentages.</p>
<p>What can we say about the specific effects of
<strong>wage_growth</strong> in this model? Recall that <span
style="color:blue">we interpret the slope as the expected change in the
outcome variable associated with a one-unit increase in the explanatory
variable, <em>controlling for all other variables in the
model</em>.</span>.</p>
<p>The coefficient estimate for the effect of
<strong>wage_growth</strong> is 0.31406. Thus we interpret this to mean
“For every percentage point increase in wages, the percent of the vote
for Hillary Clinton increased by about one-third of a percentage point,
controlling for the effect of mortality risk and the percent of the
county’s residents that were white, black, Hispanic, and
college-educated.</p>
<p>Look at the output above and answer the following questions.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default tutorial-question-container">
<div data-label="letter-a" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="letter-a-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that we never see a one percentage point increase (or decrease)
in mortality risk (that’s a big change). Thus it would make more sense
to discuss a 0.10 point change than a 1 point change. To do so we simply
divide the slope by 10. We can thus say, for every 0.10 percentage point
increase in mortality risk, the vote for Hillary Clinton is expected to
drop by -0.311711 or about one-third of a percentage point.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-conduct-hypothesis-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Conduct Hypothesis Tests</h3>
<p>We conduct hypothesis tests in the same manner as in simple
regression. Here we only test the null hypothesis that the slope for
<strong>wage_growth</strong> is equal to zero, but you can do the same
for all other variables in the model and for the intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: State the null hypothesis</strong>. <span

class="section level2">
<h2>Regression with Categorical Independent Variables with Multiple
Categories</h2>
<p>Often we will want to include nominal variables in our regression
models. Nominal variables are treated differently than interval
variables in regression analysis. Each category of a nominal variable
must be entered in the regression as its own dichotomous indicator, and
we must omit one category. This category is then represented by the
intercept. All slope coefficients on the indicator variables are
interpreted in comparison to the intercept value.</p>
<p>You are likely familiar with post-election commentary on the 2016
presidential election. Much was made of a rural/urban divide in the
electorate. If how rural or urban a county is influenced vote for
Hillary Clinton, we want to include it in our model. Further, if how
rural or urban a county is correlated with the variables already in our
model we must include it to get unbiased estimates of the effects of
those variables.</p>
<p>The data frame <strong>counties</strong> contains a variable called
<strong>UrbanCat</strong> that takes a value of 0 if the county is
rural, 1 if the county is urban, and -1 if it is neither rural nor
urban.</p>
<div id="section-estimate-a-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Estimate a Regression</h3>
<p>To include a nominal variable in a regression in R, we specify
<code>factor(categorical-variable-name)</code> rather than simply
listing the variable. You do not need to create separate dichotomous
variables for each category. R will omit one category by default, as
long as it knows the variable is a factor. Which one? <span
style="color:DarkGreen">If the variable has numeric codes, it omits the
category with the smallest value. If the variable is a character vector,
it omits the category that is first alphabetically.</span> (Note: if a
nominal variable has a factor class, you do not need to enclose it
inside the <code>factor()</code> function.)</p>
<p>Now we are ready to estimate the regression from above, adding the
nominal variable <strong>UrbanCat</strong>. Simply add it to the list of
independent variables by enclosing it inside the <code>factor()</code>
function: <code>factor(UrbanCat)</code>. Because -1 is the smallest
value of this variable and this value denotes “neither rural nor urban”,
this is the baseline category.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="lm2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>model2 &lt;- lm(dem2p_percent ~ mortality_risk_25_45 + wage_growth + college_grad_percent + hispanic_percent + white_percent + black_percent + factor(UrbanCat), data = counties)
summary(model2)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>Before we interpret our findings, note that the estimated slope for
<strong>wage_growth</strong> in this model is slightly smaller than in
the model without rural/urban status. It dropped from 0.31406 to
0.28601. This suggests that <strong>wage_growth</strong> was picking up
some of the effects of rural/urban status. In other words, some of what
appeared to be the effect of <strong>wage_growth</strong> was really due
to rural/urban status. If you look at the other estimated coefficients,
you will find additional differences. The effect of the percent Black
also dropped (from 0.12942 to 0.11028). Note, though, that our inference
about the statistical significance of none of the variables changed
(although that’s always possible).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-interpret-the-estimated-coefficients-1"
class="section level3">
<h3>Interpret the Estimated Coefficients</h3>
<p>We can interpret the interval level variable slopes in this model
exactly as above, but the categorical variables need to be interpreted
carefully.</p>
<p>First, note that in the output we see two variables named
<strong>factor…</strong> and that the category value is given at the end
of the variable name. Therefore, we see that the two categories included
are 0 and 1, the rural and urban counties, respectively, but there is no
<strong>factor(UrbanCat)-1</strong>. This is the omitted, baseline
category, neither rural nor urban.</p>
<p>Recall that the <span style="color:blue">intercept</span> describes
the expected value of the dependent variable when all the independent
variables are zero. Here if <strong>factor(UrbanCat)0</strong>=0 and
<strong>factor(UrbanCat)1</strong>=0, the county must be neither rural
nor urban, so the intercept gives the expected value of the percent of
the vote for Hillary Clinton for counties that are neither rural nor
urban, <em>when all other variables have a value of zero</em>. That vote
share is 75.97646.</p>
<p>The <span style="color:blue">slope</span> on each of the categorical
variables gives the difference between that category and the baseline
category.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The slope for rural counties <strong>factor(UrbanCat)0</strong>
is -3.49621. This tells us that rural counties, on average, cast a
smaller share of their votes for Hillary Clinton, <em>relative to
counties that are neither rural nor urban</em>, about 3.5 percentage
points fewer votes. If we subtract this value from the intercept, we
have the average percentage of the vote cast for Hillary Clinton in
rural counties, <em>when all other variables take a value of zero</em>:
75.97646-3.49621= 72.48025.</p></li>
<li><p>The most urban counties <strong>factor(UrbanCat)1</strong> cast
-0.90957 or about 1 percentage point fewer votes for Hillary Clinton,
again <em>relative to counties that are neither rural nor urban</em>. We
can again subtract that value from the intercept to get the expected
share of the vote for Clinton in urban counties <em>when all other
variables take a value of zero</em>:
75.97646-0.909576=75.06688.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we wanted to choose a different baseline category, we would need
to recode the <strong>UrbanCat</strong> variable!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-conduct-hypothesis-tests-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Conduct Hypothesis Tests</h3>
<p>The p-values on the categorical dummy variables only tell you whether
each category’s mean is significantly different from the reference
category’s mean.</p>
<p>In our example, rural counties (<strong>factor(UrbanCat)0</strong>)
cast a significantly smaller share of their votes for Clinton than did
counties that are neither rural nor urban (p&lt;0.000). However, urban
counties (<strong>factor(UrbanCat)1</strong>) did <em>not</em> cast a
significantly smaller share of their votes for Clinton than did counties
that are neither rural nor urban (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>Note that we cannot tell whether rural counties cast significantly
different shares of their votes for Clinton than did urban counties
(without some additional work)! To do so, we would need to use one of
these categories as the omitted, baseline category.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-assess-model-fit-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Assess Model Fit</h3>
<p>The proportion of the variance explained by this model is a little
bigger in this model of <strong>demp_2p_percent</strong> compared to the
model that did not include rural/urban status, inching up over 61%. The
residual standard deviation has dropped from 10.13 to 10.03. Thus,
adding <strong>UrbanCat</strong> to the model has a minimal impact on
model fit, once we have controlled for all the other variables in the
model. Note: We are able to compare fit in these two models because the
dependent variable is the same. We should be cautious, however, as we
have 3 fewer counties in this model than in the previous model (3
counties had missing values for the variable <strong>UrbanCat</strong>
that were included in the previous regression).</p>

<h2>A Second Example: The Quality of Government</h2>
<p>As a second example, we will work with data from the Quality of
Government basic data set from The Quality of Government Institute,
\url(<a href="http://www.qog.pol.gu.s"
class="uri">http://www.qog.pol.gu.s</a>). The data frame is called

overall governance score, <strong>iiag_gov</strong>. This variable
aggregates data on the rule of law, participation, human rights,
sustainable economic opportunity, and human development. This is an
interval level variable that ranges between 11. and 80.1 with a standard
deviation of 13.8. Our independent variables include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>wdi_fertility</strong>: the fertility rate in the
country</li>
<li><strong>bti_eo</strong>: a measure of equal opportunity on a scale

<li><strong>democ</strong>: a three-category ordinal variable in which
the least democratic countries are given a score of 0, the most

<h2>A Third Example: Freedom of the Press</h2>
<p>For our final example, we will analyze <strong>fh_score5</strong>,
Freedom House’s measure of freedom of the press, in countries around the
world. The variable is in the <strong>qog</strong> data frame used in
the previous example. Scores range from 0 to 100 where higher numbers
signify <strong>less</strong> press freedom. We might be interested in
knowing how the regime type influences how much freedom the press has in
a country. In particular, do more democratic countries allow more
freedom of the press? Our central variable of interest is the ordinal
variable <strong>democ</strong> used in the previous exercise. (Remember
least democratic countries are given a score of 0, the most democratic
countries a score of 2, and countries falling in the middle a score of
1.) We will treat this as a nominal variable to allow the three levels
of democracy to have unequal effects on freedom of the press.</p>
<p>We will need to control for other factors that might be related to
regime type and freedom of the press. In this exercise, we will control
for state fragility (<strong>cspf_sfi</strong>, an index ranging from 0
to 24 where 0 is least fragile and 24 is most fragile), state legitimacy
(<strong>ffp_sl</strong>, an index based on the level of corruption,
political participation, government effectiveness, power struggles and
more ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 is less legitimacy and 10 is more),
and the unevenness of economic development (<strong>ffp_ued</strong>, an
index ranging from 1 – less uneven – to 10 – most uneven).</p>
<p>Estimate the model, save the result as <strong>model4</strong> and
use the <code>summary()</code> function to present your results.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>Multiple regression analysis is a simple extension of simple
regression analysis that allows us to control for competing explanations
for some interval-level outcome. Even if our interest lies in
determining the effect of a single variable on some outcome, it is
essential that we control for additional variables to eliminate spurious
findings and to produce estimates that are unbiased. This means that we
must think carefully about the variety of factors that produce the
outcome and include variables measuring those factors if they are also
correlated with the variable of interest. In a subsequent tutorial we
will consider extensions to multiple regression analyses that allow for
conditional (or interactive) relationships where the effect of a
variable depends on the value of some other variable.</p>
<p>Like simple regression, multiple regression analysis is easy to
conduct in R using the <code>lm()</code> command, and results are easily
displayed using the <code>summary()</code> function.</p>
